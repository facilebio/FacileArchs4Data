Description: Implements the FacileData API over the v2 ARHCS4 data files. This
    involves code to speak to the hdf5 files provided by their download page,
    as well as metadata (Ensembl v107) for the human and mouse data that the
    children data packages can use to query and retrieve data from them. There
    is an official python package (archs4py) developed by the MayaanLab that
    could be used as a handy reference (see links below)
