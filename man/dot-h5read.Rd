  name,
  index = NULL,
  start = NULL,

  block = NULL,
  count = NULL,
  compoundAsDataFrame = TRUE,

\arguments{
\item{default_value}{the default value to return if the entry isn't found,
(Default: \code{NA}).}

\item{default_dim}{number of dimensions the result is expected to have,
(Default: \code{1}).}
}
\description{
This is a simple wrapper to \code{\link[rhdf5:h5_read]{rhdf5::h5read()}} which returns a default value
if the "data element" (specified by \code{name}) does not exists within \code{file}.
We use this file to read from ARCHS4 hdf5 files when we want to provide a
little insurance to the evolving nature of their data formats.

For instance this function is used when we try to read something like
\code{"meta/reads_aligned"} because this information was not provided in earlier
versions of these datasets, however \code{"meta/genes"} may use \code{\link[rhdf5:h5_read]{rhdf5::h5read()}}
directly because this has been around since "the beginning"
}
